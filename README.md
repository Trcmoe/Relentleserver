# ðŸ“¢Declare
**Relentleserver** is designed for server use and unsuitable for personal or client-side applications. If you aim to enhance your game performance, I recommend using my client-side performance modpack, [Arcomua Modpack](https://www.arcomua.com/), which can greatly improve the framerate and other aspects of gameplay.

# ðŸ“ŽIntroduction
**Relentleserve**r is a performance-focused serverpack that also includes management mods for server use. It is designed to quickly build servers with management features and good performance without changing the core gameplay. <!-- Relentleserver can be used as a basis for further customization or to simplify and optimize the server experience. -->
